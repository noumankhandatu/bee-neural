It enables users to input the URL of a PDF, specify a page range, and initiate the object detection and OCR process. The script visually displays the images containing the specified class (class 0) and subsequently extracts text and confidence levels through OCR. The recognized results are organized into a Pandas DataFrame and saved as¬†an¬†Excel¬†file.

      The Subjective-Based Auto-Grading System is an AI-driven solution
      that automates grading for subjective exam papers. Using OCR
      technology, it converts handwritten or printed text from scanned
      papers into digital format. The text is then preprocessed and
      vectorized using methods like TF-IDF or BERT embeddings. By
      calculating cosine similarity between student responses and
      reference answers, the system assigns grades automatically.
      Educators can upload papers, view results, and adjust grades
      through an intuitive interface, enhancing efficiency and
      consistency in grading.
